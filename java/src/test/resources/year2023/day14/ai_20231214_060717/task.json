If the dish is meant to focus light, all it's doing right now is sending it in a vague direction.\r\n\r\n This system must be what provides the energy for the lava! If you focus the reflector dish, maybe you can go where it's pointing and use the light to fix the lava production.\r\n\r\n Upon closer inspection, the individual mirrors each appear to be connected via an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to a large metal platform below the dish. The platform is covered in large rocks of various shapes. Depending on their position, the weight of the rocks deforms the platform, and the shape of the platform controls which ropes move and ultimately the focus of the dish.\r\n\r\n In short: if you move the rocks, you can focus the dish. The platform even has a control panel on the side that lets you tilt it in one of four directions! The rounded rocks (O) will roll when the platform is tilted, while the cube-shaped rocks (#) will stay in place. You note the positions of all of the empty spaces (.) and rocks (your puzzle input). For example:\r\n\r\n O....#.... O.OO#....# .....##... OO.#O....O .O.....O#. O.#..O.#.# ..O..#O..O .......O.. #....###.. #OO..#.... \r\n\r\nStart by tilting the lever so all of the rocks will slide north as far as they will go:\r\n\r\n OOOO.#.O.. OO..#....# OO..O##..O O..#.OO... ........#. ..#....#.# ..O..#.O.O ..O....... #....###.. #....#.... \r\n\r\nYou notice that the support beams along the north side of the platform are damaged; to ensure the platform doesn't collapse, you should calculate the total load on the north support beams.\r\n\r\n The amount of load caused by a single rounded rock (O) is equal to the number of rows from the rock to the south edge of the platform, including the row the rock is on. (Cube-shaped rocks (#) don't contribute to load.) So, the amount of load caused by each rock in each row is as follows:\r\n\r\n OOOO.#.O.. 10 OO..#....# 9 OO..O##..O 8 O..#.OO... 7 ........#. 6 ..#....#.# 5 ..O..#.O.O 4 ..O....... 3 #....###.. 2 #....#.... 1 \r\n\r\nThe total load is the sum of the load caused by all of the rounded rocks. In this example, the total load is 136.\r\n\r\n Tilt the platform so that the rounded rocks all roll north. Afterward, what is the total load on the north support beams?\r\n\r\n To begin, 14/input.\r\n\r\n Answer: \r\n\r\n You can also [Shareon https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Parabolic+Reflector+Dish%22+%2D+Day+14+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2023\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2023%2Fday%2F14\u0026related=ericwastl\u0026hashtags=AdventOfCode https://] this puzzle.\r\n\r\n ",

    "aiResponse": "Sure, below is the Go code that solves the stated problem. Save it as `main.go` in your working directory.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\n// LoadFromFile reads input from \"input.txt\" and returns a slice of strings representing each line.\nfunc LoadFromFile(filename string) ([]string, error) {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(filename)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\tvar lines []string\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\tfor scanner.Scan() {\n\t\tlines = append(lines, scanner.Scanner.Text())\n\t}\n\n\tif err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\treturn lines, nil\n}\n\n// CalculateLoad calculates the total load on the north support beams.\nfunc CalculateLoad(input []string) int {\n\ttotalLoad := 0\n\tfor rowIndex, line := range input {\n\t\tfor _, char := range line {\n\t\t\tif char == 'O' {\n\t\t\t\ttotalLoad += len(input) - rowIndex\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn totalLoad\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tinput, err := LoadFromFile(\"input.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tload := CalculateLoad(input)\n\tfmt.Print(load)\n}\n```\n\n* To compile the code, navigate to the directory containing `main.go` and run `go build`. \n* This will produce an executable named `main` (or `main.exe` on Windows). \n* Make sure the `input.txt` file is in the same directory before executing the program.\n* If you want to run the executable from the command prompt or terminal, you can execute `./main` on Unix-like operating systems or `main.exe` on Windows.\n\nMake sure the `input.txt` file is available and properly formatted as per your description. The program will then output the total load on the north support beams.",
