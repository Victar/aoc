If the dish is meant to focus light, all it's doing right now is sending it in a vague direction.\r\n\r\n This system must be what provides the energy for the lava! If you focus the reflector dish, maybe you can go where it's pointing and use the light to fix the lava production.\r\n\r\n Upon closer inspection, the individual mirrors each appear to be connected via an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to a large metal platform below the dish. The platform is covered in large rocks of various shapes. Depending on their position, the weight of the rocks deforms the platform, and the shape of the platform controls which ropes move and ultimately the focus of the dish.\r\n\r\n In short: if you move the rocks, you can focus the dish. The platform even has a control panel on the side that lets you tilt it in one of four directions! The rounded rocks (O) will roll when the platform is tilted, while the cube-shaped rocks (#) will stay in place. You note the positions of all of the empty spaces (.) and rocks (your puzzle input). For example:\r\n\r\n O....#.... O.OO#....# .....##... OO.#O....O .O.....O#. O.#..O.#.# ..O..#O..O .......O.. #....###.. #OO..#.... \r\n\r\nStart by tilting the lever so all of the rocks will slide north as far as they will go:\r\n\r\n OOOO.#.O.. OO..#....# OO..O##..O O..#.OO... ........#. ..#....#.# ..O..#.O.O ..O....... #....###.. #....#.... \r\n\r\nYou notice that the support beams along the north side of the platform are damaged; to ensure the platform doesn't collapse, you should calculate the total load on the north support beams.\r\n\r\n The amount of load caused by a single rounded rock (O) is equal to the number of rows from the rock to the south edge of the platform, including the row the rock is on. (Cube-shaped rocks (#) don't contribute to load.) So, the amount of load caused by each rock in each row is as follows:\r\n\r\n OOOO.#.O.. 10 OO..#....# 9 OO..O##..O 8 O..#.OO... 7 ........#. 6 ..#....#.# 5 ..O..#.O.O 4 ..O....... 3 #....###.. 2 #....#.... 1 \r\n\r\nThe total load is the sum of the load caused by all of the rounded rocks. In this example, the total load is 136.\r\n\r\n Tilt the platform so that the rounded rocks all roll north. Afterward, what is the total load on the north support beams?\r\n\r\n To begin, 14/input.\r\n\r\n Answer: \r\n\r\n You can also [Shareon https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Parabolic+Reflector+Dish%22+%2D+Day+14+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2023\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2023%2Fday%2F14\u0026related=ericwastl\u0026hashtags=AdventOfCode https://] this puzzle.\r\n\r\n ",

    "aiResponse": "I'm happy to help with the programming task. Below is the Go code that you can save in a file named \"main.go\". This code reads the input from \"input.txt\" in the same directory, performs the task as outlined, and prints the answer.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"failed to open file: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\trows := []string{}\n\tfor scanner.Scan() {\n\t\trows = append(rows, scanner.Text())\n\t}\n\n\tif err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Println(calculateTotalLoad(rows))\n}\n\nfunc calculateTotalLoad(rows []string) int {\n\tn := len(rows)\n\ttotalLoad := 0\n\n\tfor i, row := range rows {\n\t\tfor j := 0; j \u003c len(row); j++ {\n\t\t\tif row[j] == 'O' {\n\t\t\t\ttotalLoad += n - i\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn totalLoad\n}\n```\n\nThis Go program reads the \"input.txt\" file line by line and appends each line to a `rows` slice of strings. It then calls the `calculateTotalLoad` function to calculate the total load on the north support beams based on the puzzle requirements.\n\nTo run this program:\n\n1. Save the code into a file named \"main.go\".\n2. Ensure that \"input.txt\" is in the same directory as \"main.go\".\n3. Run the program with the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nPlease replace the `input.txt` with the actual content of your input file, as only the first few lines were provided and the code requires the full context of the input to produce the correct solution.",
