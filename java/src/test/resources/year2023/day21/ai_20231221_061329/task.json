From drivers, to businesses, to industry partners, we offer software solutions that cover all EV charging needs. \r\n\r\n--- Day 21: Step Counter ---\r\n\r\nYou manage to catch the 7 right as it's dropping someone else off on their all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island! It even helpfully drops you off near the 5 and his massive farm.\r\n\r\n \"You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow again in no time.\"\r\n\r\n While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer in for the day, and so he'd like to know which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining 64 steps.\r\n\r\n He gives you an up-to-date map (your puzzle input) of his starting position (S), garden plots (.), and rocks (#). For example:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#.#.... .##..S####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThe Elf starts at the starting position (S) which also counts as a garden plot. Then, he can take one step north, south, east, or west, but only onto tiles that are garden plots. This would allow him to reach any of the tiles marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#O#.... .##.OS####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThen, he takes a second step. Since at this point he could be at either tile marked O, his second step would allow him to reach any garden plot that is one step north, south, east, or west of any tile that he could have reached after the first step:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#O..#.. ....#.#.... .##O.O####. .##.O#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nAfter two steps, he could be at any of the tiles marked O above, including the starting position (either by going north-then-south or by going west-then-east).\r\n\r\n A single third step leads to even more possibilities:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#.O.#.. ...O#O#.... .##.OS####. .##O.#...#. ....O..##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nHe will continue like this until his steps for the day have been exhausted. After a total of 6 steps, he could reach any of the garden plots marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##.O#. .O#O#O.O#.. O.O.#.#.O.. .##O.O####. .##.O#O..#. .O.O.O.##.. .##.#.####. .##O.##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nIn this example, if the Elf's goal was to get exactly 6 more steps today, he could use them to reach any of 16 garden plots.\r\n\r\n However, the Elf actually needs to get 64 steps today, and the map he's handed you is much larger than the example map.\r\n\r\n Starting from the garden plot marked S on your map, how many garden plots could the Elf reach in exactly 64 steps?\r\n\r\n To begin, 21/input.\r\n\r\n Answer: \r\n\r\n You can also [Shareon https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Step+Counter%22+%2D+Day+21+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2023\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2023%2Fday%2F21\u0026related=ericwastl\u0026hashtags=AdventOfCode https://] this puzzle.\r\n\r\n ",

The following Go code should work assuming the input file is formatted correctly as per your example. Note that due to my inability to run the code, it may require debugging or slight modifications.\n\nCreate a file named `main.go` with the following content:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nconst steps = 64\n\n// Point represents a location in 2D space.\ntype Point struct {\n\tX, Y int\n}\n\n// InBounds checks if the given point is within the grid boundary.\nfunc InBounds(p Point, grid [][]byte) bool {\n\treturn p.Y \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 p.Y \u003c len(grid) \u0026\u0026 p.X \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 p.X \u003c len(grid[p.Y])\n}\n\n// Step in four possible directions: up, down, left, right.\nvar directions = []Point{\n\t{X: 0, Y: -1},\n\t{X: 0, Y: 1},\n\t{X: -1, Y: 0},\n\t{X: 1, Y: 0},\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error opening file:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\tgrid := make([][]byte, 0)\n\tvar start Point\n\n\t// Read the input file into a grid and find the starting point.\n\tfor y := 0; scanner.Scan(); y++ {\n\t\tline := scanner.Text()\n\t\trow := []byte(line)\n\t\tgrid = append(grid, row)\n\t\tfor x, char := range row {\n\t\t\tif char == 'S' {\n\t\t\t\tstart = Point{X: x, Y: y}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tif err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error scanning file:\", err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Using dynamic programming to count reachable points.\n\tdp := make([]map[Point]int, steps+1)\n\tfor i := range dp {\n\t\tdp[i] = make(map[Point]int)\n\t}\n\tdp[0][start] = 1\n\n\tfor s := 1; s \u003c= steps; s++ {\n\t\tfor p := range dp[s-1] {\n\t\t\tfor _, d := range directions {\n\t\t\t\tnext := Point{X: p.X + d.X, Y: p.Y + d.Y}\n\t\t\t\tif InBounds(next, grid) \u0026\u0026 grid[next.Y][next.X] == '.' {\n\t\t\t\t\tdp[s][next] += dp[s-1][p]\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Count distinct garden plots that can be reached in exactly 'steps' steps.\n\tvar count int\n\tfor p := range dp[steps] {\n\t\tif grid[p.Y][p.X] == '.' {\n\t\t\tcount++\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Println(count)\n}\n```\n\nPlease put this `main.go` file in the same directory as your `input.txt`. Compile and run the Go program with these commands:\n\n```bash\ngo build -o main\n./main\n```\n\nThis will print out the number of distinct garden plots that the Elf can reach in exactly 64 steps. Remember that this code is untested and might require debugging or modifications as per your specific environment and input file details.",
