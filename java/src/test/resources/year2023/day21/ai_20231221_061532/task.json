It even helpfully drops you off near the 5 and his massive farm.\r\n\r\n \"You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow again in no time.\"\r\n\r\n While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer in for the day, and so he'd like to know which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining 64 steps.\r\n\r\n He gives you an up-to-date map (your puzzle input) of his starting position (S), garden plots (.), and rocks (#). For example:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#.#.... .##..S####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThe Elf starts at the starting position (S) which also counts as a garden plot. Then, he can take one step north, south, east, or west, but only onto tiles that are garden plots. This would allow him to reach any of the tiles marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#O#.... .##.OS####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThen, he takes a second step. Since at this point he could be at either tile marked O, his second step would allow him to reach any garden plot that is one step north, south, east, or west of any tile that he could have reached after the first step:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#O..#.. ....#.#.... .##O.O####. .##.O#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nAfter two steps, he could be at any of the tiles marked O above, including the starting position (either by going north-then-south or by going west-then-east).\r\n\r\n A single third step leads to even more possibilities:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#.O.#.. ...O#O#.... .##.OS####. .##O.#...#. ....O..##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nHe will continue like this until his steps for the day have been exhausted. After a total of 6 steps, he could reach any of the garden plots marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##.O#. .O#O#O.O#.. O.O.#.#.O.. .##O.O####. .##.O#O..#. .O.O.O.##.. .##.#.####. .##O.##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nIn this example, if the Elf's goal was to get exactly 6 more steps today, he could use them to reach any of 16 garden plots.\r\n\r\n However, the Elf actually needs to get 64 steps today, and the map he's handed you is much larger than the example map.\r\n\r\n Starting from the garden plot marked S on your map, how many garden plots could the Elf reach in exactly 64 steps?\r\n\r\n To begin, 21/input.\r\n\r\n Answer: \r\n\r\n You can also [Shareon https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Step+Counter%22+%2D+Day+21+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2023\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2023%2Fday%2F21\u0026related=ericwastl\u0026hashtags=AdventOfCode https://] this puzzle.\r\n\r\n ",

    "aiResponse": "I can provide you with sample Go code that should solve the task as described. However, you will need to run this code locally on your machine to verify that it works correctly with your specific input data. Please note that for complex tasks, such as this one, providing fully tested and guaranteed code is outside the scope of this platform, so you may need to do some fine-tuning or debugging.\n\nHere’s a `main.go` example that you can use:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nconst (\n\tfilename        = \"input.txt\"\n\tsteps           = 64\n\tdirections      = 4\n\tstartMarker     = 'S'\n\tgardenPlot      = '.'\n\tinvalidPosition = '#'\n)\n\nvar (\n\tdx = [directions]int{0, 1, 0, -1}\n\tdy = [directions]int{1, 0, -1, 0}\n)\n\nfunc canMove(grid [][]rune, x, y int) bool {\n\tif x \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 x \u003c len(grid) \u0026\u0026 y \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 y \u003c len(grid[0]) \u0026\u0026 grid[x][y] != invalidPosition {\n\t\treturn true\n\t}\n\treturn false\n}\n\nfunc countSteps(grid [][]rune, sx, sy, remainingSteps int, memo map[int]map[int]map[int]int) int {\n\tif remainingSteps == 0 {\n\t\treturn 1\n\t}\n\n\tif _, ok := memo[sx][sy][remainingSteps]; ok {\n\t\treturn memo[sx][sy][remainingSteps]\n\t}\n\n\tcount := 0\n\tfor i := 0; i \u003c directions; i++ {\n\t\tnx, ny := sx+dx[i], sy+dy[i]\n\t\tif canMove(grid, nx, ny) {\n\t\t\tcount += countSteps(grid, nx, ny, remainingSteps-1, memo)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tif _, ok := memo[sx]; !ok {\n\t\tmemo[sx] = make(map[int]map[int]int)\n\t}\n\tif _, ok := memo[sx][sy]; !ok {\n\t\tmemo[sx][sy] = make(map[int]int)\n\t}\n\tmemo[sx][sy][remainingSteps] = count\n\treturn count\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tdata, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tlines := strings.Split(strings.TrimSpace(string(data)), \"\\n\")\n\tgrid := make([][]rune, len(lines))\n\tstartX, startY := 0, 0\n\n\tfor i, line := range lines {\n\t\tgrid[i] = make([]rune, len(line))\n\t\tfor j, char := range line {\n\t\t\tgrid[i][j] = char\n\t\t\tif char == startMarker {\n\t\t\t\tstartX, startY = i, j\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tmemo := make(map[int]map[int]map[int]int)\n\treachable := countSteps(grid, startX, startY, steps, memo)\n\n\tfmt.Println(reachable)\n}\n```\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `main.go`.\n2. Make sure the file `input.txt` with the input data is placed in the same directory as `main.go`.\n3. Run the code using a Go environment. This can be done by executing `go run main.go` in the terminal or command prompt in the directory where the files are located.\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming with memoization to count the number of distinct garden plots the Elf can reach in exactly 64 steps. You should see the number printed to the standard output when you run the code. Keep in mind the performance might vary depending on the size of your input and the complexity of the grid.\n\nAdjust the constants or logic if necessary to adapt to your specific case.",
