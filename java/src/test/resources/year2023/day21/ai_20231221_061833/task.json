It even helpfully drops you off near the 5 and his massive farm.\r\n\r\n \"You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow again in no time.\"\r\n\r\n While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer in for the day, and so he'd like to know which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining 64 steps.\r\n\r\n He gives you an up-to-date map (your puzzle input) of his starting position (S), garden plots (.), and rocks (#). For example:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#.#.... .##..S####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThe Elf starts at the starting position (S) which also counts as a garden plot. Then, he can take one step north, south, east, or west, but only onto tiles that are garden plots. This would allow him to reach any of the tiles marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#O#.... .##.OS####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThen, he takes a second step. Since at this point he could be at either tile marked O, his second step would allow him to reach any garden plot that is one step north, south, east, or west of any tile that he could have reached after the first step:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#O..#.. ....#.#.... .##O.O####. .##.O#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nAfter two steps, he could be at any of the tiles marked O above, including the starting position (either by going north-then-south or by going west-then-east).\r\n\r\n A single third step leads to even more possibilities:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#.O.#.. ...O#O#.... .##.OS####. .##O.#...#. ....O..##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nHe will continue like this until his steps for the day have been exhausted. After a total of 6 steps, he could reach any of the garden plots marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##.O#. .O#O#O.O#.. O.O.#.#.O.. .##O.O####. .##.O#O..#. .O.O.O.##.. .##.#.####. .##O.##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nIn this example, if the Elf's goal was to get exactly 6 more steps today, he could use them to reach any of 16 garden plots.\r\n\r\n However, the Elf actually needs to get 64 steps today, and the map he's handed you is much larger than the example map.\r\n\r\n Starting from the garden plot marked S on your map, how many garden plots could the Elf reach in exactly 64 steps?\r\n\r\n To begin, 21/input.\r\n\r\n Answer: \r\n\r\n You can also [Shareon https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Step+Counter%22+%2D+Day+21+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2023\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2023%2Fday%2F21\u0026related=ericwastl\u0026hashtags=AdventOfCode https://] this puzzle.\r\n\r\n ",

This can be accomplished by using a recursive Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm with a step counter.\n\nThe main points to consider in the algorithm will be:\n\n1. We should limit the search to exactly 64 steps.\n2. We must avoid walking over the same spot more than once in the same path to achieve exactly 64 steps.\n3. We cannot walk over rocks.\n4. We need to count the number of unique positions we can reach.\n\nBelow is the `main.go` file that solves the task:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nconst totalSteps = 64\n\nvar (\n\tdx               = []int{0, 0, -1, 1}\n\tdy               = []int{-1, 1, 0, 0}\n\tuniqueGardenPlots = map[int]bool{}\n)\n\nfunc walk(garden [][]rune, x, y, steps int) {\n\tif steps == totalSteps {\n\t\tuniqueGardenPlots[x*len(garden[0])+y] = true\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tgarden[x][y] = '#'\n\tfor i := 0; i \u003c 4; i++ {\n\t\tnx, ny := x+dx[i], y+dy[i]\n\t\tif nx \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 nx \u003c len(garden) \u0026\u0026 ny \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 ny \u003c len(garden[0]) \u0026\u0026 garden[nx][ny] == '.' {\n\t\t\twalk(garden, nx, ny, steps+1)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tgarden[x][y] = '.'\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\tvar garden [][]rune\n\tvar startX, startY int\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\tfor y := 0; scanner.Scan(); y++ {\n\t\tline := scanner.Text()\n\t\trow := make([]rune, len(line))\n\t\tfor x, char := range line {\n\t\t\tif char == 'S' {\n\t\t\t\tstartX, startY = y, x\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\trow[x] = char\n\t\t}\n\t\tgarden = append(garden, row)\n\t}\n\tif err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\n\twalk(garden, startX, startY, 0)\n\tfmt.Println(len(uniqueGardenPlots))\n}\n\n```\n\nPlease copy the above code into a file named `main.go`. When you run this program with your input, it will print out the number of garden plots the Elf can reach in exactly 64 steps, as long as the `input.txt` file is located in the same directory with the `main.go` file.\n\nCompile and run the program using the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngo build -o stepcounter main.go\n./stepcounter\n```\n\nPlease note, if the size of the input is too large or there are many possibilities to explore, the program might take a long time to run or consume a lot of memory due to the recursive depth-first-search algorithm. If that's the case, optimizations like memoization or a different algorithmic approach may be necessary.",
