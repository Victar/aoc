Join us! \r\n\r\n--- Day 21: Step Counter ---\r\n\r\nYou manage to catch the 7 right as it's dropping someone else off on their all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island! It even helpfully drops you off near the 5 and his massive farm.\r\n\r\n \"You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow again in no time.\"\r\n\r\n While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer in for the day, and so he'd like to know which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining 64 steps.\r\n\r\n He gives you an up-to-date map (your puzzle input) of his starting position (S), garden plots (.), and rocks (#). For example:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#.#.... .##..S####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThe Elf starts at the starting position (S) which also counts as a garden plot. Then, he can take one step north, south, east, or west, but only onto tiles that are garden plots. This would allow him to reach any of the tiles marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#...#.. ....#O#.... .##.OS####. .##..#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nThen, he takes a second step. Since at this point he could be at either tile marked O, his second step would allow him to reach any garden plot that is one step north, south, east, or west of any tile that he could have reached after the first step:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#O..#.. ....#.#.... .##O.O####. .##.O#...#. .......##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nAfter two steps, he could be at any of the tiles marked O above, including the starting position (either by going north-then-south or by going west-then-east).\r\n\r\n A single third step leads to even more possibilities:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##..#. ..#.#.O.#.. ...O#O#.... .##.OS####. .##O.#...#. ....O..##.. .##.#.####. .##..##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nHe will continue like this until his steps for the day have been exhausted. After a total of 6 steps, he could reach any of the garden plots marked O:\r\n\r\n ........... .....###.#. .###.##.O#. .O#O#O.O#.. O.O.#.#.O.. .##O.O####. .##.O#O..#. .O.O.O.##.. .##.#.####. .##O.##.##. ........... \r\n\r\nIn this example, if the Elf's goal was to get exactly 6 more steps today, he could use them to reach any of 16 garden plots.\r\n\r\n However, the Elf actually needs to get 64 steps today, and the map he's handed you is much larger than the example map.\r\n\r\n Starting from the garden plot marked S on your map, how many garden plots could the Elf reach in exactly 64 steps?\r\n\r\n To begin, 21/input.\r\n\r\n Answer: \r\n\r\n You can also [Shareon https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Step+Counter%22+%2D+Day+21+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2023\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2023%2Fday%2F21\u0026related=ericwastl\u0026hashtags=AdventOfCode https://] this puzzle.\r\n\r\n ",

    "aiResponse": "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive algorithm (commonly referred to as a depth-first search, or DFS) to count each unique position the Elf can reach in exactly 64 steps from the starting position. We will read the map from the input file, locate the Elf's starting position, then recursively explore each move until we reach the 64th step, counting each unique position we can reach on the 64th step. Below is the `main.go` file implementing the solution:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nvar steps = 64\nvar directions = [][2]int{{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}}\nvar visited = make(map[[2]int]int)\nvar start [2]int\n\nfunc readInput() ([][]byte, error) {\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\tvar mapData [][]byte\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\tfor scanner.Scan() {\n\t\tmapData = append(mapData, []byte(scanner.Text()))\n\t}\n\treturn mapData, scanner.Err()\n}\n\nfunc findStartingPosition(mapData [][]byte) (int, int) {\n\tfor y, row := range mapData {\n\t\tfor x, cell := range row {\n\t\t\tif cell == 'S' {\n\t\t\t\treturn x, y\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn -1, -1 // Ideally this should never happen\n}\n\nfunc countReachablePlots(mapData [][]byte, x, y, curStep int) int {\n\tif curStep == steps {\n\t\tif _, found := visited[[2]int{x, y}]; !found {\n\t\t\tvisited[[2]int{x, y}] = curStep\n\t\t\treturn 1\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn 0\n\t}\n\tvisited[[2]int{x, y}] = curStep\n\tcount := 0\n\tfor _, dir := range directions {\n\t\tnewX, newY := x+dir[0], y+dir[1]\n\t\tif newY \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 newY \u003c len(mapData) \u0026\u0026 newX \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 newX \u003c len(mapData[newY]) \u0026\u0026 mapData[newY][newX] == '.' \u0026\u0026 visited[[2]int{newX, newY}] != curStep {\n\t\t\tcount += countReachablePlots(mapData, newX, newY, curStep+1)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn count\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tmapData, err := readInput()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Error reading input: %v\\n\", err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tstartX, startY := findStartingPosition(mapData)\n\tanswer := countReachablePlots(mapData, startX, startY, 0)\n\tfmt.Println(answer)\n}\n```\n\nSave this code in a `main.go` file and the `input.txt` in the same directory. Run the Go program using the `go run main.go` command. The program will print the number of garden plots the Elf can reach in exactly 64 steps.\n\nPlease note that for large maps and step counts, pure DFS may be slow. To improve performance, we can use a more efficient approach like breadth-first search (BFS) with memoization or dynamic programming (DP). However, this solution should work correctly for reasonable input file sizes.",
